DFU extra image extensions

The DFU extra image module provides a flexible mechanism for including extra firmware images in the DFU packages.
This allows applications to extend the built-in DFU functionality with additional extra firmware images beyond ones supported natively in the nRF Connect SDK.

This CMake extension supports the following DFU delivery mechanisms:

* **Multi-image binary** (``dfu_multi_image.bin``)
* **ZIP packages** (``dfu_application.zip``) - For Device Firmware Update over SMP

Configuration
*************

To enable extra image support, set the :kconfig:option:`SB_CONFIG_DFU_EXTRA_BINARIES` Kconfig option.

Usage Examples
**************

Add extra binaries in your application's **sysbuild.cmake** file:

.. code-block:: cmake

   if(SB_CONFIG_DFU_EXTRA_BINARIES)
      # Include the extra DFU system
      include(${ZEPHYR_NRF_MODULE_DIR}/cmake/dfu_extra.cmake)

      # Define path to external firmware
      set(ext_fw "${APP_DIR}/ext_fw.signed.bin")

      # Create build target for the external binary
      add_custom_target(ext_fw_target
         DEPENDS ${ext_fw}
         COMMENT "External firmware dependency"
      )

      # Add extra binary to DFU packages
      dfu_extra_add_binary(
          IMAGE_ID 2
          BINARY_PATH ${ext_fw}
          PACKAGE_TYPE "all"
          DEPENDS ext_fw_target
       )

Function reference
******************

dfu_extra_add_binary()
=======================

Adds an extra binary to DFU multi-image binary and/or ZIP packages.

**Syntax:**

.. code-block:: cmake

   dfu_extra_add_binary(
     IMAGE_ID <id>
     BINARY_PATH <path>
     [IMAGE_NAME <name>]
     [PACKAGE_TYPE <type>]
     [DEPENDS <target1> [<target2> ...]]
   )

**Parameters:**

* ``IMAGE_ID``    - MCUboot image identifier (non-negative integer). Used for both multi-image 
                    packaging and ZIP packages. Must be unique and should not conflict with 
                    built-in IDs, see :ref:`sysbuild_assigned_images_ids`.

* ``BINARY_PATH`` - Path to the binary file to include in the package. The path can be absolute 
                    or relative to the build directory.

* ``IMAGE_NAME``  - Optional name for the binary file in packages. Defaults to the basename of 
                    ``BINARY_PATH`` if not specified.

* ``PACKAGE_TYPE`` - Optional package type selection: ``"zip"``, ``"multi"``, or ``"all"`` (default). 
                     Controls which package types include this binary:
                     
                     * ``"zip"`` - Include only in ZIP packages
                     * ``"multi"`` - Include only in multi-image binary
                     * ``"all"`` - Include in both package types

* ``DEPENDS``     - Optional list of CMake targets that must be built before this extra binary 
                    is available. This ensures proper build ordering.
